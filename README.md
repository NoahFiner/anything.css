# CONFIRMED

## Temporary Playground
Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/TheBITLINK/pen/JKNgxN?editors=1000) to test Î”.css, it always uses the latest version on the master branch.

When we get a site set up (if we do), a proper playground will be set up (like the one in [anythingjs.io](http://anythingjs.io/playground.html)).

# Rules
1. Nothing that'll crash a web page.
1. Can't violate GitHub terms of service.
1. Don't be an asshole.
  1. Nothing malicious.  
  1. Deleting stuff that doesn't need to be.
